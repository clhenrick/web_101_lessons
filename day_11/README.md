# Bootcamp Web Javascript Curriculum
Parsons MFA Design & Technology   
Summer 2014  

__Disclaimer:__ This is a super ultra crash course in Javascript meant to be taught in 2-3 2.5 hour classes. Definitely not the ideal way to teach a programming language but this was the given circumstances the curriculum allowed for.

## Day One
**Presentation**, view it [here](http://dtbootcamp.github.io/web/day_11_12/bootcamp-js-day-one.html#0) or download *bootcamp-js-day-one.html* and open it locally in a browser. 

Show students how to use the `console` in the Chrome browser's dev tools to illustrate examples from the slides and to get students to follow along by typing things in the console. This is outlined in [javascript_day_one_notes.md](./javascript_day_one_notes.md).

The code in the `example-code` folder demonstrates how to link an external JS file to an HTML file, using `console.log` from an external JS file, how to write to and manipulate other parts of the DOM and how functions work in JS.
