# Bootcamp Web Javascript Curriculum
Parsons MFA Design & Technology 
Summer 2014

__Disclaimer:__ This is a super ultra crash course in Javascript meant to be taught in 2-3 2.5 hour classes. Definitely not the ideal way to teach a programming language but this was the given circumstances the curriculum allowed for.

## Day Two
**Dot App** 

Review JS thus far.

Live code the app and have students follow along. With time permitting and if people aren't too lost explain the name spacing convention and why it's useful.
