# Bootcamp Web Javascript Curriculum
Parsons MFA Design & Technology 
Summer 2014

## Day One
**Presentation**, view it [here](http://dtbootcamp.github.io/web/day_11_12/bootcamp-js-day-one.html#0) or download *bootcamp-js-day-one.html* and open it locally in a browser. 

Ideally show students how to use the `console` in the Chrome browser's dev tools to illustrate examples from the slides and to get students to follow along by typing things in the console.

## Day Two
**Dot App** 

Live code the app and have students follow along. With time permitting and if people aren't too lost explain the name spacing convention and why it's useful.
