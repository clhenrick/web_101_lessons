## Positioning Recap

## Floats

### overall:
- __warning:__ floats are slowing becoming less frequently used today as we have the option of using `display: inline-block` which makes positioning easier. We also have a technique called [flex box](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Flexible_boxes) but this has more limited browser support.

- state types of float: `float: left / right / none`
- other important properties of floats to mention:
  - floated elements stack up to parent edge, then move down to next available edge
  - if floated elements are a different height then the next shorter element will float against a taller element when moving down.
  - if not enough horizontal room the element that appears first in the DOM will be placed at the top
  - if both are floated right the first element in the html will be to the farthest right

### clearing floats:
  - if the other items inside container are in danger of not extending beyond the floated item the parent container isnâ€™t going to stretch to match the height of any floated items!
  - necessary to clear the float of any floated items if it extends beyond the content of non-floated items.
  - if all elements inside container are floating it will be necessary to clear the container as well.

#### 3 methods for clearing floats
1. Clear with a subsequent element
   - next element has `clear: both;`

2. Manual clearing
   - next sibling element is empty and has `clear: both;`
   - works for extending background or border of parent container to stretch to height of parent elements

3. Clearfix
   - recommended method
   - add group class to parent container to self clear any elements inside of it.
   - allows for not needing a subsequent or empty element to extend height of container.
   - __css code:__

      ```
      /* clearfix */
        
      .group:before,
      .group:after {
        content: "";
        display: table;
      }
      .group:after {
        clear: both;
      }
      .group {
        zoom: 1;
      }
      ```
      More simple Clearfix:
 
		```
		.clearfix {
		 overflow: auto;
		 zoom: 1; /* IE 6 */
		}
		```
