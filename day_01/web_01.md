Bootcamp Web Class Day One
========
1. ### introduce myself with a slide show
  
    - __my background / history / interests__
	    - prior to parsons
	    - starting bootcamp I hated web!
	    - now
	    - social justice
	    - bikes and music :)

    - __disclaimer!__

	    - I am not an expert and don’t know everything about the web! In fact I doubt anyone is.
	    - it’s impossible to remember everything. Part of our learning will be how to search for answers online. 
	    - we will all be learning from one another, myself included. Help your neighbor!
	    - there is no one right way to learn.
	    - don’t be afraid to ask questions! No question is a dumb question.
	    - goal here is to get a basic introduction into front-end web development, not to become experts.

2. ### Ask people’s level of experience; none, some, moderate, a lot?

    - please be patient if you already have some web experience. Hang in there and ideally help your neighbor.
    - going to be explaining a lot of things, no question is a dumb question so ask away.
    - don’t make anyone else feel bad here, we all will be learning together, myself included.

3. ### Ask people to introduce themselves / play a game?
	  - what do you like to be called? (nick name)
	  - where you’re from?
	  - why you’re here?
	  - what you want to get out of this class?
	  - what’s your favorite food?

4. ### Review the syllabus & go over schedule.
	  - you will not be an expert after this class! Just introducing front-end web.
	  - what we will cover (front-end web development, hopefully with time for JS) & what we will not (PHP, MySQL, Server-side programming / back-end web dev).
	  - you should be able to: 
	    - know how to look at source code for webpages
	    - understand HTML5 and CSS3
	    - understand the basics of web design and some best practices for creating your own web pages from scratch.
	    - get an idea of what other tools are for doing web dev and design.
	    - learn about interactivity.
	
	- one note about learning how to code: 
	  - it’s very un-forgiving! it will be hard if it’s your first time! 
	  - please don’t give up! ask for help and learn how to look online for help. Also be nice and help your neighbor if they are struggling. 
	    But don’t be scared or worried that you’ll never get it. 
	  - secret: I’ve only been doing this stuff for a year now and have a much better understanding of it. 
	  - When I first started learning web I hated it and didn’t want to do it. Now I love it.
  

   -- ** _10 min break!_ ** --

5. ### Lecture: What is the web and how does it work?

	- mostly technical
	- at some point, mess with dev tools and “break” a website
	
	- semantics in HTML: keeping your page organized and meaningful
	  - important as your webpages and projects grow!
	  - will talk more about this later, but can you think of some examples?
	    - ie: “navigation bar”, “side bar”, “header”, “main content”, “carousel”, “music-player”, “search bar”, “contact info” 
	
	- describe the client <-> server relationship
	  - specific types of servers, such as servers that load map tiles, video, images, your likes and friends on Facebook, etc.
	  - most people use a service called “web hosting” that provides you with access to a server.
	  - some companies and people run their own.
	  - servers can be anywhere in the world
	
	- go to newschool.edu by entering the IP address
	- go to W3 & W3 Schools
	- describe what a database is and why you would use it (ask class if they can think of any reasons; forms, banking, registering classes, music players, online dating, weather, medical records, etc.)
	  - note: NOT EVERY WEBPAGE USES A DATABASE! (what are pages that don’t use databases? Grumpy Cat, restaurants, portfolio, page, etc.) 
	
	- content management systems or (CMS)
	  - we won't dive into programming for them but will mention them
	  - a lot of what we learn here can be applied to editing code in a CMS though

6. ### DL and install / setup stuff:
	- Google Chrome (if don’t already have it)
	- Sublime Text 2 (or an editor of your choice)
	- Cyberduck
	
	- set up your parsons a-server account
	
	- quick talk about keeping work organized, directories, files, etc.
	- talk about what Sublime Text is and why we need to use it & how to use it / how it will save us time and headache.
	
	- connect to a-server on Cyberduck
	- load something there and let’s have a look on the web?
	
7. ### Homework
	__Read the following:__

	* _HTML & CSS:_ Read the introduction chapter and chapter 1. You can download this book here. This is a very easy read and covers a lot of what we talked about today. Lots of pictures and very few words so no excuses not to read it!
	
	* Read [this article](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html) on __Character Encoding.__ Kind of technical but important to know about.
	
	* __pro tip:__ I like to use the Readability App to read text on webpages. It formats the text and removes advertisements for you. You can also save articles, tag them and view them on your mobile device.
	
	__Complete this Assignment:__
	
	Email me 3-5 websites that you like and tell me why, how it's useful or fun, what is good or bad about the design: could be the layout, use of color and typography, User Interface (UI), User Experience (UX), etc. Write a paragraph (3-5 sentences) about each one.
