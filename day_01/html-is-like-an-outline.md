HTML is like an Outline:
========================

1. Introduction (the header)
  a. about this (title)
  b. (navigation bar)
  c. something else (side bar)

2. Topic one (main content, first section)
  a. first part of topic one
  b. the second part of topic one

3. Topic Two (main content, second section)
  a. first part of topic two
  b. second part of topic two

4. Conclusion (footer in html)

It is rendered by the browser with no CSS by default styles and stacked in the order it was written in.
