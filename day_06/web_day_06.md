Bootcamp Web Class Day 06: Positioning and Floats Continued
=======

## To Cover

- go over positioning examples from day 05 that were posted to the blog over the weekend
- go through floats: left / right, inheriting, clearing them. How they can be useful: columns & nav bars.
- Setting up GitHub and using the GitHub App for Mac? (might be a better alternative to the Parsons' a-server...)
